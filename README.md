# Car Loan Payment Calculator

## Description

This project helps users determine their monthly car loan payments at 0% interest, providing an objective starting point to compare against third-party quotes. By understanding the baseline payment, users can make informed purchase decisions, and identify any additional costs like market-adjusted MSRP, loan fees, add-ons, service charges, and sales tax. This clarity helps users see the true cost of taking out a loan for a vehicle.

## Features

- Calculate monthly car loan payments at 0% interest.
- Compare the calculated payment against up to three third-party quotes.
- Highlight potential overpayments or underpayments over the duration of the loan.
- Tooltip with suggestions for understanding additional costs.

## Usage

1. Load the webpage.
2. Enter the following details:

- Optional: up to three monthly-payment quotes from third-parties.
- Vehicle price (MSRP)
- Down payment
- Loan term (in months)

3. Click the "Go!" button.
4. View the 0% interest quote and the comparison result.

### Example

If the user enters a vehicle price of $30,000, a down payment of $5,000, and a loan term of 60 months, the 0% interest monthly payment will be displayed. If third-party quotes are entered, the difference between the highest quote and the 0% interest quote will be shown, indicating potential overpayment or underpayment.
